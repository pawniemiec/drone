# Drone

Version 0.6 of `drone-server` and `drone-client` install using docker-copmose

## Installing / Getting started

### Centos
You need to have `git` installed and configured.

Install `docker` and `docker-compose`:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:pawniemiec/tools.git
./tools/centos/docker-install.sh
```

### Other OSes
Check this out: https://docs.docker.com/install/

And: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

## Before you build

### Requirements
Requirements can be found [here](./requirements.txt)

#### Domain name
You need to get publicly resolvable domain name.
There is loads of domain sellers out there so choose your own.

I created `drone` subdomain, so my drone domain looks like:
```
drone.blackfrog.io
```

#### Certificate
Before building drone server you need to obtain your own certificate.
I have used Let's encrypt. I have followed these steps:
- Downloaded [certbot-auto](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/install.html)
- run: 
```
./certbot-auto --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory -d drone.blackfrog.io --manual --preferred-challenges dns-01 certonly
```
This ^^ command asked several questions - if you run it from server drone will be running on, default answers are fine.
Please note: you need to be able to update your DNS with `_acme-challenge.drone.blackfrog.io` TXT record with the value `certbot-auto` gives you.
This step creates bunch of cert and keys in `/etc/letsencrypt/archive/drone.blackfrog.io` directory
- then I put the `chain.pem` and `privkey.pem` in ./certs/ directory

#### Drone Authentication
Drone uses 3rd party authentication mechanism called OAuth2.
It makes sense to use your Version Control OAuth2, as it will save you a step of integration your repo with drone.

## Configuration

You need to set the following variables:
```
export DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT=yellowfrog
export DRONE_GITHUB_SECRET=I_hate_storks!
export DRONE_SECRET=Not_true_I_love_storks!!!
export DRONE_HOST=https://drone.blackfrog.io
```

### Building, starting and testing

```shell
make build
make start
```
These commands will download this repo, will build the docker images for `drone-server` and `drone-client`

### Testing 
```
make test
```
